You can also use Middleware with PHP-Router. There are two ways to use Middleware; those are `before` method and `after` method. 

### Before 
`Before` method runs before route action does not trigger yet.

Request -> `BEFORE MIDDLEWARE` -> Action -> After Middleware -> Response

### After 
`After` method runs after route action triggered.

Request -> Before Middleware -> Action -> `AFTER MIDDLEWARE` -> Response

## Usage

```php
# index.php file

$router = new \Buki\Router([
  'paths' => [
      'controllers' => 'Controllers',
      'middlewares' => 'Middlewares',
  ],
  'namespaces' => [
      'controllers' => 'Controllers',
      'middlewares' => 'Middlewares',
  ],
]);

$router->get('/', ['before' => 'FooMiddleware'], 'IndexController@main');
# OR 
$router->get('/', ['before' => FooMiddleware::class], 'IndexController@main');
```

```php
# Middlewares/FooMiddleware.php
use Middlewares;

class FooMiddleware
{
  public function handle()
  {
    // your middleware codes

    return true;
  }
}
```

Your middleware class must have a method that called `handle()`.

This method must return `true` value if your middleware is pass. If the method returns another value except `true`, this mean middleware is not valid. So, your request will be blocked for routes which using this middleware. Another example:

```php
# Middlewares/FooMiddleware.php
use Middlewares;

class FooMiddleware
{
  public function handle()
  {
    if (!isset($_SESSION['auth']) && empty($_SESSION['auth])) {
      // you can redirect another url here 
      // or 
      // you can write error message, view, json response, etc...

      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }
}
```
You must definitely specify `return`. Besides, `return` value should be `true` to pass and valid the middleware. Otherwise, your request will be blocked by the middleware for current route which using the middleware as i mentioned above.
